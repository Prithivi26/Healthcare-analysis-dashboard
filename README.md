## Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare-related data using **Power BI**. It includes creating interactive dashboards, reports, and visualizations to uncover patterns, trends, and insights in healthcare data. The primary goal is to help stakeholders make informed decisions to improve healthcare services and patient outcomes.

## Skills Used
This project was a journey through key Power BI features. Here's a look at what we mastered:

-   **‚öôÔ∏è Data Transformation (ETL) with Power Query:** Cleaned, shaped, and prepared the raw data for analysis by handling blanks, changing data types, and creating new columns.
-   **üßÆ Implicit Measures:** Formulated measures to derive key insights and KPIs like `Last month waiting List` and `PY waiting List`.
-   **üìä Core Charts:** Utilized **Column, Pie, Line,**  to compare age profile, case type and waiting list trends over time.
-   **üî¢ KPI Indicators & Tables:** Used **Cards** to display key metrics and **Tables** to provide granular, sortable data.
-   **üé® Dashboard Design:** Designed an intuitive and visually appealing layout, exploring both common and uncommon chart types to best tell the data story.
-   **üñ±Ô∏è Interactive Reporting:**
    -   **Slicers:** To dynamically filter the report by Casetype and speciality.
    -   **Buttons & Bookmarks:** To create a seamless navigation experience.
    -   **Drill-Through:** To navigate from a high-level summary to a contextual, detailed view.

## Dashboard Overview
